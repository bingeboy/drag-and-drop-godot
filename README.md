# drag-and-drop-godot
This repo is for a drag-and-drop inventory in Godot 4.x that you should be able to port to other projects.

There is an Inventory control component that has a grid container and then child panels called.

### Notes:
A data file is read to load the inventory data. 

This data file is saved by hitting Enter.

Random items will spawn in the world each time the scene is launched (see the world file for these items)
